General:
--------
bsnes is a Super Nintendo / Super Famicom emulator that began on
October 14th, 2004.

The latest version can be downloaded from:
http://byuu.org/

Please see license.txt for important licensing information.


Known Limitations:
------------------
S-CPU
- Invalid DMA / HDMA transfers (eg WRAM<>WRAM) not fully emulated
- Multiply / Divide register delays not implemented

S-PPU
- Uses scanline-based renderer. This is very inaccurate, but very few games
  rely on mid-scanline writes to function correctly
- Does not support FirstSprite+Y priority
- OAM / CGRAM accesses during active display not supported correctly
- RTO flags are not calculated on frames that are skipped when frameskipping
  is enabled. This provides a major speedup, however it will cause in issues
  in games that test these flags, eg the SNES Test Program Electronics Test.
  Turning frameskipping off will allow RTO flag calculation on every frame

Hardware Bugs
- CPUr1 HDMA crashing bug not emulated
- CPU<>APU communication bus conflicts not emulated
