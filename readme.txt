Shortcut Keys:

Known Limitations:
------------------
S-CPU
- Invalid DMA / HDMA transfers not fully emulated
- Multiply / Divide register delays not implemented

S-PPU
- Uses scanline-based renderer. This is very inaccurate, but few (if any)
  games rely on mid-scanline writes to function correctly
- Does not support FirstSprite+Y priority
- OAM / CGRAM accesses during active display not supported correctly
- RTO flags are not calculated on frames that are skipped when frameskipping
  is enabled. This provides a major speedup, however it will cause in issues
  in games that test these flags, eg the SNES Test Program Electronics Test.
  Turning frameskipping off will allow RTO flag calculation on every frame

Hardware Bugs
- S-CPU.r1 HDMA crashing bug not emulated
- S-CPU<>S-SMP communication bus conflicts not emulated
